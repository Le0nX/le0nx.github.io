# Hello,

<img src="/img/me.jpeg" alt="me" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; height: 200px;">

Hello,
I am Denis,

Currently, I am a software engineer in Moscow, what can I tell you about me?

Clearly, I am very interested in iOS app development. Previously I was working on the helicopter-tpe UAV project in a small startup. 

One important part of me is my curiosity, you can see all my unrelated projects. Basically, I am curious and love learning and sometimes I get carried away. I have ‘developed’ OS from scratch, love investing, created some web pages, hacked some cars, learn several languages, etc. etc.

I don’t know what else to tell you, so, for now, I will let some links in which you can learn more about who I am:
